Did you use the same type of route to update patient information and to update an employee department?
To update patient all information I used PUT and to update only the employee department I used PATCH

Why did you choose the strategy that you chose?
Because Patch updates 1 or more values, depending what I want to update and Put update all the info associated with the object

What are the pros and cons of the strategies you chose for creating these routes?

What are the tradeoffs between PUT and PATCH?
